# FletRt

---

FletRt is a really simple routing solution for the Flet framework, developed mainly for personal use.

Flet is a Python framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies. FletRt allows you to
create multiple views for your Flet app and navigate between them using routes.

Please note that this project is still incomplete and lacks many features available on Flet.

This project core is slightly based off CodingJQ's [ Routing in Flet with Python in 3 Min (Tutorial) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrmcIofA5bM)
